# ysi_batch_prediction
The objective of this project is to use SMILES/Name/CAS to fetch measured YSI and predicted YSI via an API (https://ysi.ml.nrel.gov/api) made by Dr. Peter St. John at NREL (https://github.com/pstjohn)
The input is an excel called compounds.xlsx. The output is another excel called YSI results.xlsx.
